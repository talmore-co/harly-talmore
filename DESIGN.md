# Harly — Style Reference

> A quiet, human hiring workbench on warm paper — soft off-white surfaces, real people in every row, and a single chartreuse pulse that marks only what is live, selected, or decisive.

**Theme:** light

**North-star mock:** [`public/images/figma-preview/dashboard-hero.png`](public/images/figma-preview/dashboard-hero.png)
**External reference:** [Remote by Modula](https://remotebymodula.framer.website/) (soft SaaS shell, human tables, lime signal)
**Product one-liner:** Harly is a self-hosted ATS that feels like a calm morning desk — not an enterprise suite, not a feature warehouse.

### Reference lock

The local screenshot reference pack was removed from the repository before
launch. The rules below remain the source of truth for density, chrome, and
visual hierarchy; the north-star composition is also represented by
`public/images/figma-preview/dashboard-hero.png`.

**Reading the frames (rules extracted, not vibes):**

- Chrome is a single 56px bar. One row of icons left, one pill centered, one compact cluster right. Nothing else.
- The table is the page *in that frame*. Read the frame for its **density and chrome budget**, not its information architecture , see the Home note below.
- Selection is a **filled soft row block with its own radius**, and the trailing `…` cell darkens with it. No borders, no checkmark-only state.
- Column headers are small, letterspaced, soft-ink — quiet structure.
- Chartreuse appears exactly four times in frame 01: brand mark, `Tech` chips, the AI icon button, the workspace dot. Count yours.
- Status pills are cool-grey and silent. Category tags are either solid ink (`Product`) or chartreuse (`Tech`) — never both styles for the same taxonomy level.
- Avatars are real photographs at 36px in rows, 24px in stacks, initials on soft kraft as fallback.

Harly operates as a **light engineering-adjacent people tool**: warm paper canvas (`#f5f5f4`) with near-black typography (`#171717`) and a single chartreuse accent (`#c8f560`) that activates only live signals — selected rows, category chips, brand marks, unread dots, active nav. Structure comes from **luminance and spacing**, not ornament: soft row washes instead of card farms, hairline borders that disappear until looked for, minimal shadow. The outer app shell is a generous rounded white frame; the sidebar is an **icon rail**, not a module warehouse. Density is comfortable. People are the UI — real avatars, soft initials, team stacks. The product's intelligence is the workbench itself: triage, pipeline, and decision — never decorative chrome.

> **Authority rule for agents and humans:** If implementation conflicts with this file, **this file wins**. Fix the code. Do not “almost” match the mock.

## Product posture (identity before pixels)

| Decision                   | Rule                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary object             | **Application** — a person in a job — not abstract “modules”                                     |
| Primary surfaces           | **Shell** → **People / applications list** → **Pipeline** → **Candidate focus**                  |
| Secondary                  | Inbox, Jobs, Calendar                                                                            |
| Tertiary (not primary nav) | Career Page, Templates, Documents, Talent Pool, People (team), Reports, Integrations, Developers |
| Home is                    | A **triage cockpit**: greeting → countable "what needs me" strip → the work, ranked by urgency    |
| Candidate focus is         | Decision rail + resume/context — **not** 8 equal tabs                                            |
| AI is                      | Optional guidance inside flows — **not** a permanent noisy FAB identity                          |
| Coming soon                | Never in primary chrome (topbar / sidebar). Hide or bury until real                              |

### Sacred screens (redesign order)

1. **App shell** (icon rail + quiet top bar + workspace pill)
2. **Home** (triage cockpit) and the **candidates directory** (the Jessica-table density)
3. **Candidate focus panel** (contextual primary action by stage)
4. **Pipeline board** (same density language as the list)
5. Everything else inherits — do not redesign Settings or Career first

### Home is a cockpit, not the reference frame (learned the hard way)

The former employee-directory reference frame is an **employee directory with a
salary column** — an HR/payroll surface. It was the reference for *density,
chrome budget, selection language and type*, and it is **not** the reference for
what Home shows.

Translating it literally once already produced a Home that was a flat table of
applications. That is the wrong question: a directory of everyone answers "who
exists", and Harly already answers that at `/dashboard/candidates`. Home has to
answer **"what needs me today"**.

The order is fixed, and it is a ranking, not a grid:

| Rank | Zone            | Contents                                                     |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Greeting        | Avatar + `Good morning, {First}!` + one operational subline   |
| 2    | **Triage strip**| ≤4 countable, clickable answers to "what needs me"           |
| 3    | The work        | Candidates awaiting a decision (widest), today's interviews   |
| 4    | Context         | Pipeline health, inbox                                        |
| 5    | Analytics       | Tasks, hiring performance — useful, never urgent              |

Widgets are allowed. **Equal-weight widgets are not.** Every element on Home must
be able to answer "why are you above the thing below you".

## Tokens — Colors

| Name              | Value     | Token                       | Role                                                                                                                        |

| Row Wash          | `#f0f0ee` | `--color-row-wash`          | Hover and selected table rows — the signature soft highlight from the north-star mock                                       |

| Soft Ink          | `#6a6a67` | `--color-soft-ink`          | Secondary body, captions, column headers, quiet meta — ≥4.5:1 on paper                                                      |
| Quiet Mist        | `#9a9a96` | `--color-quiet-mist`        | Placeholder text, disabled labels, tertiary meta                                                                            |
| Hairline          | `#ececea` | `--color-hairline`          | Borders that almost disappear — structural only, never decorative frames                                                    |
| Mist Border       | `#e4e4e1` | `--color-mist-border`       | Slightly stronger dividers on pure white (tables, input rings at rest)                                                      |
| Chartreuse Signal | `#c8f560` | `--color-chartreuse-signal` | **Rationed** accent: brand dots, Tech/category chips, active marks, unread, AI-live indicators, rare primary marketing CTAs |
| Chartreuse Ink    | `#2a330d` | `--color-chartreuse-ink`    | Text/icons on chartreuse fills                                                                                              |
| Sage Wash         | `#eaf6c8` | `--color-sage-wash`         | Soft selected/active tint behind nav items or chips — never a full-page wash                                                |
| Sage Ink          | `#44520f` | `--color-sage-ink`          | Text on sage wash                                                                                                           |
| Ink Action        | `#171717` | `--color-ink-action`        | Default filled button / decisive admin action (not olive, not green mass)                                                   |
| Status Quiet      | `#e8eef2` | `--color-status-quiet`      | Neutral status pill background (e.g. Pending)                                                                               |

| Tag Solid         | `#171717` | `--color-tag-solid`         | High-weight category tags (e.g. Product) — black pill, white text                                                           |

### Accent rationing (non-negotiable)

Chartreuse is a **live signal**, not a theme color:

- **Yes:** category chip `Tech`, brand mark, selected control, unread badge, sparse marketing CTA
- **No:** page backgrounds, large primary button fields across the admin app, decorative blobs, every active state in the product

Default admin primary action = **Near Ink** fill + white label.
Chartreuse primary = marketing / rare high-delight moments only.

## Tokens — Typography

**Harly is set in Onest. One family, two faces, a hard role split.** Onest is a geometric humanist sans with open apertures and a warm, slightly rounded skeleton — it reads as a *people* tool on paper, where a neo-grotesque like Inter reads as a dashboard. The reference frames are set in exactly this register: friendly letterforms, tight headline tracking, quiet small caps-ish column heads.

### Onest — Static instances — the primary face · `--font-onest`

Everything the user reads as **content or command**: paragraphs, buttons, nav labels, table cells, names, forms, greetings, page titles, empty states.

- **Weights (self-hosted static instances only):** `400` Regular · `500` Medium · `600` SemiBold
- **Substitute:** system UI sans (`ui-sans-serif`, `-apple-system`) — never Inter
- **Sizes:** 12px, 13px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 32px
- **Line height:** 1.15 for display sizes, 1.35–1.50 for body
- **Letter spacing:** `-0.01em` at 14–16px, `-0.02em`/`-0.03em` at 20px+, default below 13px
- **Role:** Medium (500) is the workhorse for row names, nav labels, buttons and chips. Regular (400) for paragraphs and meta. SemiBold (600) **only** for greetings, page titles and table-row names — never a whole section of it.
- **Display is the same face, not a second family:** greeting weight comes from `600` + `-0.03em` tracking, applied via the `font-display` utility.

### Onest Variable — the secondary/chrome face · `--font-onest-var`

Reserved for **small standalone chrome that labels rather than speaks** — the pieces that must hold at 11–12px without turning to mush, where a live weight axis lets us go slightly heavier without going bigger.

- **Use for:** status pills (`Pending`), category chips (`Tech`, `Product`), badges, counters, unread dots with numbers, `AI` micro-chips, table column headers, keyboard hints (`⌘K`), micro meta.
- **Axis range:** `100 900`, driven at `500`–`600` in practice
- **Sizes:** 11px, 12px, 13px only
- **Letter spacing:** `0.02em` at 12px, `0.04em` at 11px — small text needs air, unlike display
- **Never use for:** body copy, buttons with real verbs, names, headings, or anything longer than three words. If it's a sentence, it's the static face.

> **The split in one line:** static Onest *speaks*, variable Onest *labels*. A chip is a label. A button is speech.

### Type Scale (product UI)

| Role      | Size | Weight  | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Face     | Token             |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| micro     | 11px | 500     | 1.3         | 0.04em         | variable | `--text-micro`    |
| caption   | 12px | 500     | 1.35        | 0.02em         | variable | `--text-caption`  |
| chip      | 12px | 500     | 1.2         | 0.01em         | variable | `--text-chip`     |
| col-head  | 12px | 500     | 1.2         | 0.06em         | variable | `--text-col-head` |
| body-sm   | 13px | 400     | 1.45        | —              | static   | `--text-body-sm`  |
| body      | 14px | 400     | 1.45        | -0.01em        | static   | `--text-body`     |
| body-ui   | 15px | 400–500 | 1.4         | -0.01em        | static   | `--text-body-ui`  |
| label     | 13px | 500     | 1.3         | —              | static   | `--text-label`    |
| row-name  | 15px | 500     | 1.3         | -0.01em        | static   | `--text-row-name` |
| title-sm  | 16px | 600     | 1.3         | -0.01em        | static   | `--text-title-sm` |
| title     | 20px | 600     | 1.25        | -0.02em        | static   | `--text-title`    |
| greeting  | 24px | 600     | 1.2         | -0.03em        | static   | `--text-greeting` |
| display   | 32px | 600     | 1.15        | -0.03em        | static   | `--text-display`  |

**Column headers (tables):** `col-head` — 12px, variable face, medium, soft ink, `0.06em` tracking. Matches frame 01 (`USERS  ROLE  STATUS`): quiet structure, never a shouty bold uppercase wall.

**Eyebrows:** rare. Max sparingly in marketing. Product UI prefers plain titles without `01 / SECTION` agency labels.

**Numerals:** tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) in every table column, counter and metric so digits stop dancing between rows.

---

## Tokens — Spacing & Shapes

**Base unit:** 8px
**Density:** comfortable (Remote-soft, not Linear-cockpit, not enterprise-cramped)

### Spacing Scale

| Name | Value | Token          |
| ---- | ----- | -------------- |
| 4    | 4px   | `--spacing-4`  |
| 8    | 8px   | `--spacing-8`  |
| 12   | 12px  | `--spacing-12` |
| 16   | 16px  | `--spacing-16` |
| 20   | 20px  | `--spacing-20` |
| 24   | 24px  | `--spacing-24` |
| 32   | 32px  | `--spacing-32` |
| 40   | 40px  | `--spacing-40` |
| 48   | 48px  | `--spacing-48` |
| 64   | 64px  | `--spacing-64` |

### Border Radius

| Element                              | Value     | Token             |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| small controls (checkbox, tiny chip) | 8px       | `--radius-sm`     |
| inputs, small buttons, menus         | 12px      | `--radius-md`     |
| cards, panels, table shell           | 16px–20px | `--radius-lg`     |
| selected rows / soft blocks          | 14px–16px | `--radius-row`    |
| pills (status, filters, primary CTA) | 9999px    | `--radius-pill`   |
| app outer shell / large frame        | 24px–28px | `--radius-shell`  |
| avatars                              | 9999px    | `--radius-avatar` |

**Shape doctrine:** Pills for **chips + primary CTAs + filters**. Rows and panels are **soft rectangles**, not mega-pills. Do not make every container `rounded-full`.

### Shadows

| Name  | Value                               | Token            | Role                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| none  | `none`                              | —                | Default for flat paper UI              |
| soft  | `0 1px 2px rgba(23, 23, 23, 0.04)`  | `--shadow-soft`  | Barely-there lift on pure white panels |
| float | `0 8px 30px rgba(23, 23, 23, 0.06)` | `--shadow-float` | Popovers, command menu, dialogs only   |

Depth = **row wash + paper contrast**, not drop shadows on every card.

### Layout (app)

- **App shell:** full viewport; content in soft white frame on paper (optional outer radius on desktop)
- **Icon rail width:** 56–64px collapsed default
- **Top bar height:** 56px
- **Content horizontal padding:** 24–32px
- **Table row height:** 56–64px (human, tappable, Remote-like)
- **Max reading width for settings copy:** 640px
- **Dashboard content:** fluid; prefer one hero table over multi-column widget soup

## Components

### App Outer Shell

**Role:** The product frame from the north-star mock

Large rounded white/ light container on warm paper (or edge-to-edge paper with inner white stage). No heavy browser chrome toys. Feels like a single calm window, not a pile of cards.

### Icon Rail Sidebar

**Role:** Primary navigation

Talmore uses a 224px labeled sidebar, expanded by default, with a remembered 60px collapsed mode. Active destinations use a soft row wash. This agency navigation replaces the original five-icon rail and More menu wherever older sections of this guide describe them. See `docs/navigation.md`.

Direct destinations:

1. Home
2. Inbox
3. Pipeline
4. **Candidates** (the directory)
5. Jobs
6. Clients (agency company directory)

Work groups Inbox, Tasks and Calendar. Recruiting groups Pipeline, Candidates,
Jobs and Clients. Documents and Reports follow. Settings and Your account stay
pinned below the scrollable links. Talent pool lives under Candidates; Career
page, Templates, Team & access and document configuration live in Settings.

**Why Candidates is primary:** Home is a triage cockpit , it answers "who needs a
decision today", which is deliberately not "everyone we have ever talked to".
Looking a person up by name is a daily motion, so the directory cannot live three
clicks deep. Clients is the agency-specific exception to the original five-item limit.

### Top Bar (Quiet Chrome)

**Role:** Global context without noise

- Left: optional mobile trigger only
- Center: **workspace pill** (`Remote / All ▾`) — soft border, tiny brand chartreuse dot
- Right: compact cluster — compose/new (chartreuse icon button), avatar, search, notifications, menu
- **No** “Coming soon” activity stubs
- **No** competing page title + breadcrumb circus; page title lives in content

### Morning Greeting Header

**Role:** Home identity moment

Avatar + `Good morning, {FirstName}!` in greeting scale (24px semibold tight). Subline optional and **short** — operational, not cheerleader (“3 candidates need review”), never “Let’s go! 👋” as brand voice.

### Filter Chip Row

**Role:** Lightweight list controls under greeting

Pill chips: `Team All ▾`, `Status Pending ▾`, job/stage filters. Resting fill soft kraft; open/active may use sage wash or ink text. Height ~32–36px.

### Human Data Table

**Role:** Hero surface of Harly (applications / people work)

- Quiet uppercase-ish or small column headers in soft ink
- Rows 56–64px with avatar, name (near ink, medium), role/title, status pill, meta, team stack, `…` menu
- **Selected rows:** row wash background + rounded row block (as mock) — not thick borders
- Checkboxes soft, circular or rounded-sm consistent with system
- Bulk selection implies a quiet bulk bar (Advance / Email / Reject) — not a floating toolbox of 15 actions

### Status Pill

**Role:** State without drama

Fully pill. Quiet mist/blue-gray fill for neutral (`Pending`). Semantic colors only for hired/rejected when needed. 12px medium text. Never chartreuse for every status.

### Category Chip

**Role:** Sparse taxonomy (department, track)

- **Solid ink** chip for heavy tags (`Product`)
- **Chartreuse** chip for signal tags (`Tech`) — rationed
- 11–12px medium, pill, no icons required

### Team Avatar Stack

**Role:** Hiring team / collaborators

Overlapping circular avatars (24px), soft ring of pure snow, initials fallback on soft kraft or muted pastel. Max 3 + count.

### Primary Button (Ink Pill)

**Role:** Default decisive action in admin

Pill radius. Background near ink. Text pure snow. 14–15px medium. Padding ~10px 18px. Hover slightly lifts to softer black. **This is the workhorse CTA inside the product.**

### Signal Button (Chartreuse Pill)

**Role:** Rare high-signal action (New, Try, marketing, brand moments)

Pill. Background chartreuse signal. Text chartreuse ink. Same padding as primary. Do not use on every form submit.

### Secondary / Ghost Button

**Role:** Cancel, secondary

Pill or soft-rect 12px radius. Transparent or soft kraft. Border hairline/mist. Text near ink.

### Destructive Button

**Role:** Reject / delete

Rust fill or ghost-rust. Never chartreuse. Confirm in dialog for irreversible trash.

### Row Action Menu (`…`)

**Role:** Per-entity overflow

Quiet icon button; menu with 12px radius and soft shadow float. Keep global toolbars thin by pushing rare actions here.

### Candidate Focus (target pattern)

**Role:** Decide on a person

Two-zone layout:

- **Main:** resume / profile / timeline
- **Rail:** stage, primary action (Advance / Schedule / Offer), reject secondary, activity compact

Maximum **3** process sections or tabs for simple decision surfaces. Primary action **changes with stage**.

**Exception , complex workspaces:** Candidate Profile is not a 3-rung decision hierarchy, it is a set of independent functional modules (Profile, Interviews, Communication, Evaluation, Offers, Activity, Documents, Privacy). Forcing those under 3 umbrella tabs stacks every module's `TabsContent` on top of the others under one shared tab value, producing a single endless-scroll page instead of exclusive views. For this surface, use flat, exclusive tabs , one module per tab, `overflow-x-auto` on the tab list for small screens , instead of grouping into Overview/Process/Files.

### Empty State

**Role:** Teach the next job-to-be-done

Soft dashed or wash panel, one illustration-or-icon in sage/chartreuse wash square (16–20 radius), title, one sentence, one ink or signal CTA. Copy is operational (“Publish your first job”), not generic (“No items yet”).

### Command Menu

**Role:** Power user fast path

Float shadow, 16–20 radius, pure snow, kraft active row. Keyboard first. Preferred home for AI actions over a permanent FAB.

### Toast / Feedback

**Role:** Transient confirmation

Minimal, soft corners, ink text; success uses success olive sparingly.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Compare every UI PR to the north-star composition in this file and `public/images/figma-preview/dashboard-hero.png`
- Set text in **Onest** — static face for speech, variable face for labels (chips, statuses, badges, column heads)
- Keep primary nav ≤5 visible destinations; bury the rest under More/Settings
- Use **row wash** for selection/hover instead of boxing every entity in a card
- Ration `#c8f560` to signals — chips, dots, rare CTAs, brand
- Default product CTAs to **near-ink pills**
- Rank Home by urgency (triage strip → decisions → context → analytics), never by symmetry
- Let AI **suggest** in the language a colleague would use ("Strong fit", "Harly can be wrong , you decide"), collapsed by default, never louder than the person's name
- Use real avatars and human row height (56–64px)
- One icon family project-wide (pick **Phosphor** _or_ **Lucide**, not both)
- Let hairlines be almost invisible; structure with space
- Write quiet operational copy; short greetings; no hype

### Don't

- Don't ship a labeled sidebar of 10–14 modules as the default IA
- Don't make Home a bento of six equal metric cards
- Don't use chartreuse as the global primary button color in admin
- Don't introduce olive/pine as a second “brand primary” competing with ink + lime
- Don't mix three icon libraries in one tree
- Don't put “Coming soon” in the top bar or primary nav
- Don't default Candidate to 8 equal tabs and a 12-button action bar
- Don't use heavy shadows, glassmorphism stacks, or AI-purple gradients
- Don't use pure `#000000` large fields or pure neon decoration
- Don't add agency eyebrows (`01 / INDEX`), scroll cues, or fake version stamps in product UI
- Don't reintroduce **Inter** (or Geist Sans / any second UI sans) anywhere — Onest is the only family
- Don't set body copy, buttons or headings in the **variable** face, and don't set 11–12px chips in the static face
- Don't put an irreversible decision (hire, reject, delete) behind a hover-revealed control on a card or row
- Don't let an AI panel explain its own emptiness — if it has nothing to say, it renders nothing
- Don't redesign Career/Portal aesthetics before Shell + Home + Candidate focus match this file

## Surfaces

| Level | Name              | Value     | Purpose                                       |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Warm Paper        | `#f5f5f4` | App canvas, sidebar plane                     |
| 1     | Pure Snow         | `#ffffff` | Shell, panels, popovers, elevated table stage |
| 2     | Soft Kraft        | `#efefed` | Chips at rest, secondary fills                |
| 3     | Row Wash          | `#f0f0ee` | Hover/selected human rows                     |
| 4     | Sage Wash         | `#eaf6c8` | Soft active tint (nav, subtle highlight)      |
| 5     | Chartreuse Signal | `#c8f560` | Live signal only                              |

## Elevation

- **Default controls & rows:** none — luminance + wash
- **Popover / dialog / command:** `--shadow-float`
- **Optional white stage on paper:** `--shadow-soft` at most

## Imagery

- **People first:** photographic avatars, soft neutral fallbacks (no hard comic illustrations in core tool)
- **Brand:** Harly wordmark/mark; chartreuse only as a small pulse in logo lockups when needed
- **Product marketing** may use soft 3D or clean UI frames; **admin app** should not rely on isometric hero art
- **No** stock-photo wallpaper backgrounds inside the tool
- Career pages are workspace-branded (customer brand), not Harly chartreuse-forced

## Layout

Full-viewport light app. Icon rail left. Quiet top bar with **centered workspace pill**. Main stage is breathable paper/snow with **one dominant work surface** (table or pipeline). Filters sit under a human greeting. Selection is multi-row soft wash. Right-side detail (candidate) should slide as a calm panel, not a modal storm. Settings use simple stacked sections — still paper/snow, still ink CTAs — never a different visual universe.

Portal may use a calmer candidate-facing variant, but must share: radius scale, type, accent rationing, human density. Do not invent a second brand.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**

- canvas: `#f5f5f4`
- surface: `#ffffff`
- text: `#171717`
- muted text: `#6a6a67`
- border: `#ececea`
- row selected: `#f0f0ee`
- signal: `#c8f560` (rare)
- text on signal: `#2a330d`
- default CTA fill: `#171717` / text `#ffffff`
- danger: `#d6453a`

**Hard bans for agents**

1. No new primary nav items without updating this file
2. No Coming soon in chrome
3. No flat bento of equal-weight cards on Home , rank by urgency instead
4. No second accent color family (purple/blue brand)
5. No second type family — **Onest only**; Inter is retired, not deprecated
6. One surface per task — Shell, then List, then Candidate

**Example Component Prompts**

1. **Icon rail:** 56px wide, paper background, 5 icons max, active item soft kraft/sage rounded-12 wash, no text labels when collapsed.

2. **Workspace pill (top center):** height 32px, pure snow, hairline border, 14px radius or pill, left chartreuse 8px dot, text “{Workspace} / All ▾” in 13–14px soft/near ink.

3. **Greeting block:** 32px circular avatar + “Good morning, Jessica!” at 24px semibold tracking-tight near ink. Optional one-line soft-ink subtitle ≤12 words.

4. **Human table row:** 60px tall, 16px horizontal padding, avatar 36px, name 14–15px medium, role body, status quiet pill, team stack, `…`. Selected: full-row `#f0f0ee` at 14–16 radius.

5. **Filter chips:** pill, soft kraft bg, 13px medium, chevron; no heavy border.

6. **Primary admin button:** pill, `#171717` bg, white label 14px medium, padding 10×18.

7. **Signal chip Tech:** pill, `#c8f560` bg, `#2a330d` text, 12px medium, **Onest Variable**, `0.01em`.

8. **Candidate focus:** left 1fr profile/resume; right 320–360px decision rail with **one** primary stage action + overflow menu. Max three sections.

9. **Column header row:** 12px, **Onest Variable** 500, `0.06em` tracking, `#6a6a67`, uppercase-ish label only (`USERS`, `ROLE`, `STATUS`) — no border under it, spacing does the separating.

**Quick Type Reference**

- family (speech): `var(--font-onest)` — 400 / 500 / 600
- family (labels): `var(--font-onest-var)` — variable axis, driven 500–600
- greeting: 24px / 600 / `-0.03em` / static
- row name: 15px / 500 / `-0.01em` / static
- body: 14px / 400 / `-0.01em` / static
- chip + status: 12px / 500 / `0.01em` / **variable**
- column head: 12px / 500 / `0.06em` / **variable**
- tabular numerals on every metric and table figure

---

## Dark / Light Rhythm

Harly admin is **light-first**. Rhythm is paper → snow → row wash, not dark/light marketing bands.

- Optional **marketing site** may use stronger contrast sections later; not required for product identity.
- **Dark mode:** defer until light identity is faithful. If implemented, map paper→deep charcoal, snow→elevated charcoal, keep chartreuse signal, never invert randomly per section.
- **Portal:** may use a deeper sidebar for candidate calm, but content stage stays light and human.

---

## Similar Brands (calibration, not clones)

- **Remote (product + Modula template)** — soft paper, human tables, lime signal chips, quiet chrome, generous rows — **primary north star**
- **Linear** — ruthless IA restraint, keyboard speed, chrome minimalism (steal discipline, not pure dark cockpit)
- **Ashby** — hiring-native density and candidate decisioning (steal workflow clarity, not visual noise)
- **Mercado / modern HR soft UIs** — avatar-first lists, pill filters, friendly but serious

**Not similar:** generic shadcn dashboard demos, purple AI SaaS landings, Greenhouse-heavy enterprise chrome.

## Voice & microcopy

| Do                         | Don't                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| “3 candidates need review” | “Let’s go! 👋 Your hiring journey awaits”  |
| “Publish your first job”   | “No data yet”                              |
| “Advance to Interview”     | “Submit” on stage changes                  |
| “Reject” (clear, grave)    | Soften irreversible actions into cute copy |

Language: clear, calm, adult. English product UI default; same tone in ES if localized.

---

## Accessibility

- Text on paper/snow ≥ **4.5:1** (soft ink already tuned)
- Chartreuse chips: always use **chartreuse ink** text, never white on lime
- Icon-only controls require `aria-label`
- Focus rings: near ink or sage, 2–3px visible — never remove focus
- Don't rely on lime alone for state — pair with text/icon

### Bridge note (current codebase)

Legacy `globals.css` mapped `--primary` to olive/pine, set Inter for every role, and kept domain names (`pine`, `sage`, `lime`).
**Mapping for the redesign:**

| Legacy                    | Becomes                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--paper`                 | Warm Paper                                 |
| `--paper-raised`          | Pure Snow                                  |
| `--kraft`                 | Soft Kraft                                 |
| `--ink`                   | Near Ink                                   |
| `--ink-soft`              | Soft Ink                                   |
| `--lime`                  | Chartreuse Signal                          |
| `--sage`                  | Sage Wash                                  |
| `--primary` (admin)       | **Ink Action** (not pine)                  |
| pine-as-brand             | **retired** as primary                     |
| `--font-inter`            | `--font-onest` (static)                    |
| `--font-inter-display`    | `--font-onest` @ 600 + tight tracking      |
| Inter for chips/badges    | `--font-onest-var` (variable face)         |
| `inter.woff2`             | **deleted** — no Inter file ships          |

`pine` and `sage` stay as *aliases* so existing consumers (`bg-sage`, `text-pine`) inherit the retheme untouched — but no new code may reference them. New surfaces use the DESIGN.md names.

Fonts are self-hosted under `apps/web/src/app/fonts/onest/` (F5-04: the build never reaches `fonts.googleapis.com`).

---

## Pass / Fail checklist (PR gate)

A UI change **fails** review if any box is true:

- [ ] Adds a top-level nav item without DESIGN.md update
- [ ] Home gains another card at the *same* weight as its neighbours, instead of finding its rank in the triage order
- [ ] Uses chartreuse on a non-signal decorative block
- [ ] Introduces a second icon library
- [ ] Ships Coming soon in sidebar/topbar
- [ ] Candidate surface adds tabs beyond the three-section cap without explicit exception
- [ ] Visually diverges from the north-star composition on shell/list density without written reason
- [ ] Introduces Inter, Geist Sans, or any font family other than Onest
- [ ] Sets a chip/status/badge in the static face, or body/button copy in the variable face

A UI change **passes** when:

- [ ] It could sit inside the north-star mock without looking like another product
- [ ] Accent appears only as signal
- [ ] Chrome is quieter than content
- [ ] People (avatars, names, rows) are the first thing the eye hits

## Redesign execution order

| Phase | Scope                                      | Done means                           | Status |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 0     | This file + freeze feature UI sprawl       | Agents cited DESIGN.md               | **done** — Onest lock + reference lock |
| 1     | Tokens bridge + button/chip/row primitives | Story-level match to mock chips/rows | **done** — Onest self-hosted, Inter/Cal Sans deleted, `--primary` is ink, radius + shadow doctrine, `components/ui/human-table.tsx` |
| 2     | App shell (rail + top bar)                 | ≤5 primaries; workspace pill center  | **done** — `IconRail` replaces the shadcn sidebar kit; no Coming soon; AI FAB retired into the top bar signal button |
| 3     | Home = triage cockpit                      | Greeting + triage strip + ranked work | **done** — see the Home note below. Landed as a table first, corrected to a cockpit |
| 4     | Candidate focus                            | Decision rail; ≤3 sections           | **done** — 8 tabs → Overview / Process / Files; 10-control bar → primary + stage action + reject + utilities |
| 5     | Pipeline                                   | Same density language                | **done** — columns are paper regions with a funnel-progression dot, cards read as people not mini-cards, Hire/Reject removed from cards, AI collapsed |
| 6     | Cascade (Inbox, Jobs, Settings skin)       | Inheritance, not reinterpretation    | **partial** — `Badge`, `FilterPill` and `PipelineSpine` are on-spec, so every consumer inherits; per-screen QA not done |

### Known open items (do not re-derive , these are deliberate, not forgotten)

1. **Icon families still mixed.** Lucide and Phosphor both ship. One family must win; the rail, top bar and human table are Lucide, so Lucide is the likely survivor. Mechanical but wide.
2. **Pipeline board cards** keep their old card language. They should read like table rows in a column, not mini-cards.
3. **Dark mode** has correct tokens but no per-screen QA. Light identity was the priority, per this file.
4. **Career page and Portal** are untouched on purpose , brand surfaces come after the daily tool, and the Portal keeps its deeper sidebar by design.
5. **`.font-cal` is a retired alias** resolving to Onest display. New code uses `.font-display`; the ~14 old call sites can be renamed opportunistically.

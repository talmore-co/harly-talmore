- Answers to application questions
- Links to professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio)

## AI in our process

We use AI tools to help parse resumes and organise application data. AI is a tool that helps our team work faster, but it does not make hiring decisions. Every decision involving your candidacy is made by a human.

If you have questions about how AI was used in evaluating your application, just ask.

---

## Complaints

You have the right to complain to your local data protection authority. We'd much rather resolve any concern directly, so please reach out first.
`,

  aiTransparencyNotice: `# AI Transparency Notice

**Last updated:** {{DATE}}

{{ENTITY_NAME}} uses AI tools as part of our recruitment workflow. This notice explains what AI does, what it doesn't do, and what rights you have.

---

## Where AI is involved

### Resume parsing

When you upload a resume, AI extracts structured information, including work history, education, skills, and contact details, to pre-fill application fields and help our team quickly understand your background. No data beyond what you submitted is used.

### Job description drafting

AI may assist our team in drafting job descriptions and candidate communications. All AI-generated content is reviewed and edited by a human before it's published or sent.

---

## Where AI is not involved

We want to be explicit about this:

- **AI does not score or rank candidates.** There is no automated scoring system that determines whether you advance.
- **AI does not make hiring decisions.** Every decision, including screening, interviews, offers, and rejections, is made by a human.
- **AI does not assess protected characteristics.** We do not use AI to infer or evaluate race, gender, age, religion, disability, or any other protected attribute.

---

## Human oversight

Our hiring team reviews all application data directly. AI outputs are treated as a starting point, never a final answer. If AI parsing produces incorrect information, candidates can correct it before submission.

---

## Your rights

Under the EU AI Act and GDPR, you have the right to:

- **Know** that AI tools are involved in processing your application (this notice)
- **Request an explanation** of any AI-assisted step in your evaluation
- **Request human review** of any decision that affects you
- **Object** to processing by automated means

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at [{{ENTITY_EMAIL}}](mailto:{{ENTITY_EMAIL}}).

---

## Questions

We're happy to explain how AI is used in any specific part of the process. Just email [{{ENTITY_EMAIL}}](mailto:{{ENTITY_EMAIL}}).
